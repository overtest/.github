# Meet, Overtest ðŸš€!

**Overtest** is an online judging system for holding programming competitions and long-term educational processes in schools and universities, where students learn programming. It has a simple and adaptive web interface, allowing users to practice algorithmization and programming on the go. You can use it with your learning management system like [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) or [Open edX](https://open.edx.org/) - integration is simple and doesn't take much time. Overtest is very tiny, secure, and scalable. It doesn't take too many system resources, can run in VM or containers, uses advanced system APIs to protect your hardware from potential threats (or misuse by your students ðŸ˜…).

## Three easy steps to use Overtest in your class

1. Create a new programming task using Overtest TaskForce - it's quick and easy! You need to describe the problem your students need to solve, set up some specific tests information, and give your solution for the task.
2. Upload a ready-made zip archive, exported from TaskForce, with your task configuration to Overtest using a web application or command-line utility.
3. Invite your students to complete the task you have created. That simple!
