# Meet, Overtest ðŸš€
**Overtest** is an online judging system for holding programming competitions and long-term educational processes in schools and universities, where students learn programming. It has a simple and adaptive web interface, allowing users to practice algorithmization and programming on the go. You can use it with your learning management system like [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) or [Open edX](https://open.edx.org/) - integration is simple and doesn't take much time. Overtest is very tiny, secure, and scalable. It doesn't take too many system resources, can run in VM or containers, uses advanced system APIs to protect your hardware from potential threats (or misuse by your students ðŸ˜…).

## Four easy steps to use Overtest in your class

1. Set up a local Overtest instance on the server of your educational institution - it's easy!
2. Create a new programming task using [Overtest Task Generator](https://github.com/overtest/overtest-task-generator) extension for Visual Studio Code - it's quick and easy! You need to describe the problem your students need to solve, set up some specific tests information, and add your own solution for the task.
3. Upload a ready-made `*.zip` archive with your task configuration, exported from the Task Generator, to Overtest using a web application or command-line utility. Or you can use ready-made programming tasks from our public archive, and add your own tasks to it!
4. Invite your students to complete the task you have created. That simple ðŸ˜Š!
